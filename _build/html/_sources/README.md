# Welcome to my playground :D

My name is Mimi and I enjoy all areas machine learning and Deep Learning networks, but most importantly, random processes. In my spare time, I fiddle with different challenges across mathematics, Physics and Programming but not limited to losing myself in my projects dealing with Large Language Models. 

If you ever catch me outside, you would probably find me making a sandwich. 

## Projects
- AgentDial : In-cooperating humanistic features to Large language models' way of speech
- AgentHub : Common space to build Mini Agent's from quantized models
- AgentLink : API nodes
- Naomi Chatbot: Hiring Agent that I have built to assist my dating life
